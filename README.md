# google-image-history
A small art project where the idea is to create a historic archive of google image searches for each country in the world. I was particularly struck by how when you do an image search of Afghanistan you are greeted by images of war and wanted to see if this changes per country over time. There are also interesting political situations in say Venezuela at the moment that show up and it's potentially interesting to see how this differs in the 6 months to a year.

I aim to take a set of images every 6 months and archive them.

I'm using phantom.js to scrape for images.

Use:
cd into the js directory
phantomjs render_multi_url.js to start
