# google-image-history
A small art project where the idea is to create a historic archive of google image searches for each country in the world. I was particularly struck by how when you do an image search of Afghanistan you are greeted by images of war and wanted to see if this changes per country over time.

I'm using phantom.js to scrape for images.

phantomjs render_multi_url.js to start
